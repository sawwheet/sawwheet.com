      <description>&lt;p&gt;This past weekend I ran a &lt;code&gt;Ragnar Relay Race&lt;/code&gt; near Zion national park. Given the proximity, I of
course took the opportunity to visit Zion as well. A little foreshadowing: the majority of the hikes,
including Angel&amp;rsquo;s Landing and The Narrows, are shuttle access only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went into the park on two different days. The first day was the day I drove in, so it wasn&amp;rsquo;t until
mid afternoon. I met up with my brother and we made our way down to the visitors center. This is
also where you park, and take the shuttle as mentioned earlier. The parking lot was PACKED, luckily
we were both able to find a spot, and ended up doing one of the 2 hikes that did not require a
shuttle.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
