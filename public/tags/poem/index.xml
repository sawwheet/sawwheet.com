      <description>&lt;p&gt;A lot of times in life you seem to have no idea what you are looking
for. There is a yearning for something more, something to fill you up,
but you don&amp;rsquo;t know what it is. That is not how I feel. I know exactly
what I am looking for, and I know exactly where to find it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with what I am looking for, is that it is on the other
side of a lake. This lake is slowly expanding and as a result, what I
seek is becoming further away. I jump in and start swimming, but the
freezing water only adds to the pain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For her, there is love and respect;&lt;br&gt;
For me, there is sadness and regret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hope holds strong,&lt;br&gt;
but it cannot be trusted.&lt;br&gt;
The pain is proglonged,&lt;br&gt;
as long as it survives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will there be another?&lt;br&gt;
Will it meet the same fate?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am stuck in limbo;&lt;br&gt;
I am stuck in my head.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Heartbreak</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;All is good; The path is well lit. There are steep inclines and rough terrain. But not to worry, the
path paves the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a single moment, it goes dark. Another moment goes by, and the path is gone. The incline grows
steeper, and the terrain rougher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The traveler sees a single light in the far off distance, and hopes the path will return. Another
path has been paved, but it does not lead to the desired destination. The traveler is left with a
choice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have a question;&lt;br&gt;
to which there is no answer.&lt;br&gt;
Perhaps upon reflection,&lt;br&gt;
I will find direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the door,&lt;br&gt;
the embrace of clarity.&lt;br&gt;
The teacher is fair,&lt;br&gt;
and she will listen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside is rain,&lt;br&gt;
a cloud of shame.&lt;br&gt;
I go back the way I came.&lt;br&gt;
Until next time Miss Jane.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What I Feel</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/what-i-feel/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What I feel is confusion. It is sadness, and a longing. There is disappoinment, and there is hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confusion arises when the day is good, and the moment is sad. Longing sinks in when she breathes
indifference. Disappointment overwhelms when efforts are not reciprocated. Yet there is hope,
in the form of adventure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to run away. I want to seek meaning and connection in new places. The remedy seems to sit in
the heart of adventure, needing only courage. It is a temporary measure, of that I am aware. The
human condition does not care.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
