      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have a question;&lt;br&gt;
to which there is no answer.&lt;br&gt;
Perhaps upon reflection,&lt;br&gt;
I will find direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the door,&lt;br&gt;
the embrace of clarity.&lt;br&gt;
The teacher is fair,&lt;br&gt;
and she will listen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside is rain,&lt;br&gt;
a cloud of shame.&lt;br&gt;
I go back the way I came.&lt;br&gt;
Until next time Miss Jane.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What I Feel</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What I feel is confusion. It is sadness, and a longing. There is disappoinment, and there is hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confusion arises when the day is good, and the moment is sad. Longing sinks in when she breathes
indifference. Disappointment overwhelms when efforts are not reciprocated. Yet there is hope,
in the form of adventure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to run away. I want to seek meaning and connection in new places. The remedy seems to sit in
the heart of adventure, needing only courage. It is a temporary measure, of that I am aware. The
human condition does not care.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
