I find that I am 'at my best' when I am aware of how fragile my life is, and have appreciation for
the conditions that form my life. In other words, being filled with humility is what brings me the
most fulfillment. Humility brings about a sense of awe, and an urgency to live while I can. When I
recognize the nuance and complexity of one system, and realize that it is only one of many systems,
how can I not be humbled?

Without humility, my problems are amplified and I believe that they must be solved if I wish to
truly live. Yet I look around me at the plants, animals, and other humans and see that life flows
regardless of any one's problems. Why would the universe care about my wishes and desires? I have
had plenty of wishes and desires fulfilled in my life, yet here I am still caught in between
contentment and dissatisfaction. Balance finds a way. This leaves me with no option but to humble
myself and accept what comes my way.

With humility, I find the richest experiences arise from pure amazement in what the cosmos
produces. Everything I experience is just a result of the arising conditions moment to moment. I
take what I can get with the understanding that nothing is owed to me. There is nuance in each
moment, I just have to look for it. There are adventures to be had, I just need the courage to
embark on them. With this disposition, there is nothing better to be experienced than a walk in the
dark.
