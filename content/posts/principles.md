## About {#about}

Understanding the art of living is at the heart of my reading, writing, and reflective
pursuits. These principles, shaped by my underlying values, illustrate that understanding and I hope
to apply them daily, regardless of my external circumstances. This living document outlines the core
of who I want to be, and the presence I want to provide to the world.


## Embody Peace {#embody-peace}

I intend to move through the world with equanimity and presence, listening with the intent to
understand, and expressing honestly. The moment will have my full attention, without judgment.


## Invoke Wonder {#invoke-wonder}

I intend to be mindful of the miracle of life. As I explore the cosmos in the pursuit of wisdom, I
will stay focused on the big picture and maintain a mindset of awe, appreciation, and humility.


## Encourage Growth {#encourage-growth}

I intend to shape my body and mind through physical and intellectual action. There has been limited
vitality granted to me, and I will use it to grow by embracing challenge and interacting with the
world.


## Align With Nature {#align-with-nature}

I intend to understand and align with the patterns and systems that govern our universe. By
embracing my connection to the natural world, I will allow its laws to balance to my life and
relationships.
