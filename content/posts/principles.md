## About {#about}

Understanding the art of living is at the heart of my reading and writing pursuits, and my
principles illustrate that understanding. I hope to apply these principles, shaped by my underlying
values, daily regardless of my external circumstances. This living document outlines the core of who
I want to be, and the presence I want to provide to the world.


## Embody Peace {#embody-peace}

I intend to move through the world with equanimity and presence, listening with the intent to
understand and expressing honestly. The moment will have my full attention, without judgment.


## Invoke Wonder {#invoke-wonder}

I intend to be mindful of the miracle of life. As I explore the cosmos in the pursuit of wisdom, I
will stay focused on the big picture and maintain a mindset of awe, appreciation, and humility.


## Encourage Action {#encourage-action}

I intend to shape my body and mind through physical and intellectual action. There has been limited
vitality granted to me, and I will use it to grow by embracing challenge and interacting with the
world.
