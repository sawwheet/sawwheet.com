A lot of times in life you seem to have no idea what you are looking for. There is a yearning for
something more, something to fill you up, but you don't know what it is. That is not how I feel. I
know exactly what I am looking for, and I know exactly where to find it.

The problem with what I am looking for, is that it is on the other side of a lake. I see what I
want, it is just a quick swim away. The lake is slowly expanding and as a result, what I seek is
becoming further away. I jump into the lake and start swimming, but the water is much too cold, only
adding to the pain.

This lake is my past, and all I can do is stand by while it grows.
