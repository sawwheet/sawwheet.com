The world we live in is one of continuous cause and effect. There is no moment that is separate from
the conditions that preceed it. Each individual exists as an expression of a force that perfectly
embodies these conditions. You can call it God, The Tao, or Nature. Either way, there is no other
option than to submit to it. Submission does not mean complacency, it means integration. Each day I
awake with a new set of conditions to work with. What other option do I have than to embrace what
exists now?

Only with this acceptance and surrender can we learn to flow in our life. The only sane disposition
is one that faces the present moment head on. I find it beneficial to direct my stream of life in a
way that is congruent with what I want. However, I am loosely attached to the outcomes of these
desires. What I wish to cultivate is an internal resilience and mental fortitude that accepts the
present conditions with mindfulness and vitality. I do not know the problems I will face today, but
I know they will come. I have learned there is no final destination. There is no set of conditions
that will permanently satiate me; the truth of impermanence prevails. This means I will not wait for
my problems, for that is analgous to a stone in a river. The rigid do not flourish in a world of
impermanence, the malleable do.

Take action, move on, and learn from the results. My actions will have consequences in the world
beyond my private mind. This is because I am an integral part of life itself, not an independent
entity. As I write this, I am recalling my own experiences and the work of other introspective types
that resonate with me. I see with clarity how I came to be in this moment, and it is completely
dependent on the interconnected nature of our universe. My actions arise from this truth, and they
leave a mark that impact future truth.
