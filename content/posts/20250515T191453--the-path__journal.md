All is good; The path is well lit. There are steep inclines and rough terrain. But not to worry, the
path paves the way.

In a single moment, it goes dark. Another moment goes by, and the path is gone. The incline grows
steeper, and the terrain rougher.

The traveler sees a single light in the far off distance, and hopes the path will return. Another
path has been paved, but it does not lead to the desired destination. The traveler is left with a
choice.
