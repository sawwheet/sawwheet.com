I have had a great day. I continue to turn to Buddhism for inspiration, and continue to find that
aligning myself with its teachings can produce these great days. This is the same reason I like
Protesilaos so much. The work of Buddhism and the work of Prot instill a positive outlook on life in
me. It is important for me to remember that I must apply what they say to my life, and not attempt
to replicate it exactly. I must keep in mind my wants and needs.

I have been able to maintain a state of gratiude and see with a sense of clarity. I feel like I was
able to nourish my joy and appreciation for life, while saying no thank you to my suffering. I do
this by channeling my inner Thich Nhat Hanh. Yes I feel the sadness and confusion of a break up
arrive throughout the day, but I let it go. It is ok to feel that sadness, and I show compassion
towards it, but I do not need to feed it. This is easier said than done on many days, but it is
important to remember that it is possible. This is where faith becomes important. When I am feeling
stuck, and that life is not worth living, I need to have faith that genuine that joy and optimism is
possible in any situation. I need to have faith that feeling this joy and wonder makes life worth
living and that I should fight through whatever battle it is that I am facing.

There is beauty to experience in this world as long as there is consciousness. You will never have
all the answers, but as long as there is a mind, there is a way to build a beautiful
world. Journaling like this is important because it helps you see what the common themes are that
help you see this beauty. There is wonder to be found in every moment, and when that wonder is found
you have to feed it. This is what the Buddha means when he talks about nutriments. It is important
to pay attention to what you feed your mind, because it will contribute to your
experience. Happiness produces more happiness.

When you see clearly that nothing in this world is owed to you, you become appreciative of what is
in front of you. I am lucky to have the vitality to interact with this world. I am lucky to have the
vitality to play disc golf.

Setting goals is fine, and even good for a sense of direction. You just have to ensure these goals
align with what you really want. Knowing what you really want is not always easy, because you cannot
just say "happiness". You have to know what fills you with a sense of wonder and joy, and sometimes
this is not easy to find. Lately, I have been finding bouldering and disc golf to fill me with
joy. So my goals should be set around doing these activities. This is the idea I was trying to
express in my journal entry about [Buckets of Experience](./buckets-of-experience.md). Having a
sense of direction is nice. Having confidence in what you are doing feels good. This also starts to
lead into the idea Prot is trying to express
[here][https://protesilaos.com/commentary/2025-10-19-two-sides-commitment/]. If you think through
the goals you set, then you have confidence in why you are pursing them and can do it with your full
mind. The outcome does not matter, because you have the humility to understand that outcomes are
beyond your control. Nonetheless, you commit to it with a sense of wonder in the every day. You feed
this wonder, while keeping an eye on the bigger picture.
