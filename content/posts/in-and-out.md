In represents focus. Attention is directed towards the task at hand; Your mind is at capacity with
context of the work.

Out represents wandering. Taking a step back to observe the whole, and letting consciousness flow.

The meeting point of in and out represents moderation; It represents harmony. When you over indulge in
the out, you become out of touch. You forget that human life, all life, requires work. While lost in
the out, you risk becoming trapped in the depths of the meaningless void. Too much time spent in,
and appreciation disappears. Deep within the in are the little things; These little things latch on,
but they do not matter.

When balance is found, and you ride the wave that is in and out, experience is seamless. You become
capable of creating a life worth living. When you are in, you make progress; When you are out you
appreciate the progress. While out, you understand that the little things will be your demise, and
while in, you understand change is possible.
