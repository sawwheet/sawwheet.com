This past weekend I ran a `Ragnar Relay Race` near Zion national park. Given the proximity, I of
course took the opportunity to visit Zion as well. Something you need to know about Zion is that
where all the hikes are, including Angel's Landing and The Narrows, are shuttle access only.

I went into the park two days. The first day was the day I drove in, so it wasn't until mid
afternoon. I met up with my brother and we made our way down to the visitors center. This is also
where you park, and take the shuttle as mentioned earlier. The parking lot was PACKED, luckily we
were both able to find a spot, and ended up doing one of the 2 hikes that did not require a
shuttle.

The next day, I went into the park by myself around 10 a.m. with the plan of doing Angel's
Landing. I tried on two different occasions to get a parking spot, but both times was
unsuccessful. I was not the only disappointed visitor desperately trying to find a spot. This was on
a week day by the way.

It ended up being a chance to explore though. I went to one of the pull offs on the side of the road
and ended up finding a pretty cool slot canyon!

Here is another picture I got from one of the pull offs.

Then I did the Ragnar Relay. There were not any vikings there, it is a decieving name.

A Ragnar Relay is a trail race between teams. Each team is composed of 8 members (unless
you are extreme, then you can do 4) and each person has to run 3 loops: 7mi, 4mi (with 700ft
elevation gain), 4mi (with much less elevation gain). This totals 15-16 mi. Only one person on
the team runs at a time, and there are no breaks once you start. That means that everyone ends up
running in the middle of the night at least once. I ran around 11pm and again at 5:30 am. The night
run was super cool. I loved the cool breeze, the stars, and the lack of a brutal sun beaming down on
you.

Here is me finishing my last loop:

This was a cool experience. Unfortunately I am going through some pretty signifcant relationship
problems so I wasn't able to be fully present, but it was cool nonetheless.
